To solve the problem, I went through each of the breakpoints I made. I noticed that multiplication and addition worked,
as addition returned 7 and multiplication returned 70. When it got to division, however, even though it had the
right inputs, it returned 0. The only way to do that is if you used the remainder operator (%) instead of division (/).
I changed the operator to '/' and the program worked as intended, outputting 35.
